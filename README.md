## ðŸ“œ How It Works

1. The user navigates through questions using **Next** and **Previous** buttons.
2. Selection is saved in `userAnswers` (state).
3. Navigation is disabled unless an option is selected.
4. Final score is calculated by comparing user responses to `questionBank`'s correct answers.
5. On finish, a **Result** component displays the score with an option to **Restart**.
